## Introduction:
Food nutrition plays a crucial role in our daily decisions to maintain optimal health. Whether it's individuals tracking their daily nutritional intake or others simply seeking quick nutritional information about specific food items, having an easy-to-use tool can make a world of difference. Imagine a tool where you enter the name of the food item(s) and weights in grams, and within seconds, you receive the total nutritional values.

In this mini project, I developed a nutritional calculator using Python, designed specifically for this purpose. It provides a fast and efficient way to access detailed nutritional information, empowering users to make informed choices about their health.
